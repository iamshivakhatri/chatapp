# Chat App with PDF, YouTube, and Audio Interactions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) chat application that enables you to interact with PDFs, YouTube videos, and audio files through a conversational interface. The app is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and powered by advanced AI, allowing seamless document and media interaction.

## Features

Here are the key features of the app:

### PDF Chat Creation
